## How to use

Just clone it and get going.

$ git clone --depth=1 https://github.com/Jugacu/express-api-server-starter.git <your-project-name>

cd  <your-project-name>

# Maybe remove the `.git` directory and start with a fresh one.

# install all dependencies.
$ npm i

# Start developing and serve your app:
